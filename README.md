My Student Project: C# for Beginners : Assignment #1 (Series)
Permission to publish my code submitted for the project assignment was granted by the professor.

This is a very simple console application that I completed for a class assignment. It is shown here to illustrate my coding style, structure, and commenting. This example is considered Level 1 – Easy.

Objective:
Part 1 – Pet Owner
The application should ask the user for the name, age, and gender of a pet (or any animal).
The values are to be saved in the program and then the program should display the information
back to user.

Part 2 – Program your own object
Look around at home, at your work, or wherever you are at this moment. You will find numerous
objects, a chair, a baby, a TV, a house, or a car. Choose your one favorite object and program
it as in Part 1.
